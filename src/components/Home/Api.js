Over the course of three years, and supported by over $500,000 (USD) in funding from Cure Rare Disease, SickKids will build upon existing research and aims to develop a CRISPR/Cas9-based treatment to correct gene duplications that cause DMD by restoring full-length dystrophin, a protein critical to muscle strength and function.  DMD is a rare, fatal muscle-wasting disease caused by the body’s inability to produce dystrophin. “We are excited to have SickKids, Canada’s premier pediatric hospital, join our collaborative research efforts to develop CRISPR-based therapies for Duchenne muscular dystrophy,” said Rich Horgan, founder and president of Cure Rare Disease.  “This collaboration is a major milestone in our work to hopefully expand our drug development pipeline and continue building our pioneering model to create and dose customized therapeutics for rare diseases like DMD.”", imgurl2: img79

However, the album was clearly written during a much different time in the pair’s romance, as it’s mostly full of sad breakup songs like “Make You Miss Me” and “Breakup In A Small Town.Even though the two probably weren’t on the best terms when he put the album out, he made sure to get her advice before putting the songs out to the world. “I spent a lot of time talking to her about the songs and asking, ‘What do you think about this?'” he revealed to Billboard in 2015. “Her perspective was a powerful part of me being able to connect with a female audience.””", imgurl2: img87

The blue zones are comprised of five regions:During his research, Buettner discovered that not only was longevity common in these areas, but there was also an absence of many of the chronic illnesses, such as obesity, and heart disease, that plague many other cultures in the world. The people also spent less time in sedentary behaviors and seemed to experience less stress. Remarkably, these populations don’t rely on public health messages to “eat less, move more;” rather, their health and longevity is directly related to their lifestyles. Inhabitants of the blue zones live in environments that make it possible for them to live their best lives by moving naturally, connecting to their “right tribe” and eating foods that are largely unprocessed, seasonal and fresh. Buettner identified nine traits that contribute to blue zone longevity, which he has termed the Power 9.", imgurl2: img92

Once you’ve done this a few times and have listened to the recordings, you have essentially taught your brain to chase the reward of feeling better after exercise or any physical activity. You have created a behavioral loop in which you have taught your brain how to enhance mood and derive a powerful and positive effect from a single exercise effort.A single action that leaves you feeling better emotionally or mentally expands possibilities and generates hope. It also helps you reframe exercise and change it from a motivational challenge to a mood-transforming opportunity.It’s worth noting that this strategy can be employed and work equally well when going for a walk or any other form of physical activity. Incidental physical activity may not be as intense as exercise and, in general, does not feel as daunting or challenging as exercise to many people.", imgurl2: img93

For those days, a Tabata-style workout may be the answer.", cat: "fitness", blog_content: "For the warm-up to each workout, the HITT-T group did a four-minute warm-up on the treadmill, the HIIT-WB group used the same body-weight exercises but moved at a much slower tempo for four minutes, and the MICT group gradually increased running tempo. At the end of the 16-week training protocols, each group had improved their fitness levels, which was measured by time to reach VT2 and the time to reach exhaustion. The HIIT-T group demonstrated better results than the HIIT-WB or MICT groups, supporting the idea that HIIT is a time-efficient workout solution. This is great news for those days when time can be a factor and a gym workout just isn’t feasible. In other words, when time gets tight, a four-minute Tabata workout may be sufficient for maintaining your current level of fitness.When time is tight, it can be difficult to do your usual 30- to 60-minute workout. For those days, a Tabata-style workout may be the answer. Tabata is a form of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that requires just four minutes to complete.
